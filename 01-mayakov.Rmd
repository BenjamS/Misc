# Introduction {#intro}

Mayakovsky noticed the divot of air the Sun's absence had left  
atop slender-buttressed walls of May,  
and raised his voice to the top of his spine,  
in a brimming toast to the end of the age.  

But the crippled milieu had not done with the black bread of facile rhyme,  
and sent up an infinite, disconsolate moo,  
instead of the sunlight, to fill the sky.  

And since that day, there've been many a Pskov king,  
and many a bread line on the Kuznetsky.  
and many who prefer a scathing weight,  
to the helium feet of the apogee.  

Returning the rose window of Sun to its place in the cathedral-sky,  
Mayakovsky was not monarch, but Gagarin,  
of what he surveyed. "And history is a church again",  
the cosmonaut's gazing declaimed,  
from the bosom of the rocket blast.  

"Poets should not give speeches on tarmacs  
at the hour of liftoff", the Octobrist posters replied,  
as they peeled from the walls of May.
