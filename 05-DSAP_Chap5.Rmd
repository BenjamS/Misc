# Chapter Five

Clinical Preface

Here presented for the first time is the so-called “Dead Souls” manuscript, authored by General Mikhail Tukhachevsky sometime between 1923 and 1931, while he was an intern at the Volokhskaya mental asylum, along the Volga River, near St. Petersburg, Russia.
The manuscript is presented in this easily accessible, “Everyman’s Edition,” without extensive notes or commentary, because it holds something for everyone, from military behavioralists to industrial gematryists.  The commentary and annotated editions are sure to be forthcoming, as this little book will generate much discussion.
Since I am named in the manuscript as one of its primary “characters,” and since my N.E.W. work of the period, here at Arlington, is now common (and declassified) knowledge, I have been asked to write this short preface introducing Level 5 to this remarkable document.
The manuscript here presented was apparently stored away in a ward filing cabinet in the corner of the psychiatrist’s office at Volokhskaya, where it lay preserved and forgotten for over eight decades.  In 1997, during the facility’s conversion to a tourist resort, the file cabinet was moved to the cellar, but the document remained undiscovered. It is only thanks to the recent re-emergence of Soviet Communism and the careful re-expropriation of the Volokhskaya estate that the Dead Souls manuscript ever came to light at all.
From the psychiatric standpoint, however, we have here nothing less than the first concrete example of a phased-compound prismotic event. From the other records that we have been able to retrieve from Volokhskaya, it is clear that Tukhachevsky entered the asylum diagnosed with acute compound schizophrenia (the patient projects a false personality which in turn projects another false personality).  The records also note a major deterioration in Tukhachevsky’s condition during his sophomore year—coinciding with the introduction of certain journal-keeping therapies prescribed by his doctor—but the diagnosis was not modified at any point during Tukhachevsky’s nine years at Volokhskaya.  It is my opinion that in this second year after being committed, Tukhachevsky’s condition deteriorated to what is now called a phased transpersonal event-schizophrenia, or a phased-event compound schizophrenic prismosis, of which the Dead Souls manuscript that follows is the mimetic focal of the phased-compound event cycle.
I make this claim because I treated the patient who was the inverse pole of the transpersonal (and trans-temporal) Tukhachevsky event cycle.  My patient, whose name remains classified, was also a war veteran (of a postmodern American war), and also thought he was Chichikov from Gogol’s novel Dead Souls.  And when he entered the “convalescent” phase of the compound cycle, his secondary projections were the converse of Tukhachevsky’s.  That is to say, whereas Tukhachevsky thought he was returning to sanity as my patient, my patient thought he was returning to sanity as General Tukhachevsy, and he projected the intimate elements of General Tukhachevsky’s life in the same detail that General Tukhachevsky projects certain details of my patient’s life in the manuscript below.  I can only say it is a shame the manuscript did not come to light earlier—it would have been very helpful in understanding the perplexing motives of my own patient, and in avoiding the unfortunate measures we ultimately were forced to take with him.
What about my “role” in the manuscript?  I can affirm only that the clinical mimesis, while not exact, is indeed conspicuous—about as grotesque and conspicuous as its “literary” resemblance to Gogol’s poem.  Beyond that I must conserve my silence. However, I do so only partly to protect the classified information that still surrounds the affair.  There is a better reason, and the sharpest among you in Level 5, after some reflection, will understand what is meant by the silence.

Ted and Linda are here to pick you up and take you out to lunch.  We have lots to talk about when you get back.”
Chichikov looked around and noticed the reserve of bright blue sky above their heads, restive and empty.  A loud metallic clapping noise penetrated his nerves again and again; an immense American flag beating against the silvery flagpole.  Turning completely around he beheld the massive edifice of the ward, whose edges curved elliptically away and disappeared from view.
“Were at the front of the ward,” said Chichikov.
“That’s correct, Chichikov, and your cousin Ted and his wife Linda are here to take you out to lunch today.  See them there?” said Hank, pointing toward the end of the cement promenade.
“What was it?  What happened to me?” said Chichikov.
“Here they come now.”
Ted and Linda had crossed the parking tarmac and were approaching the wide cement and granite promenade that skirted the entrance to the ward.
“Hey, Chichikov!”
Chichikov spun around and looked beseechingly at Hank—overcome by a giddy, dizzy sensation—that he had to struggle, briefly, just to encompass himself.  He felt a sudden impact against his body, and looked down at the two children who were wrapped around his legs and waist.
“Uncle Chichikov!  Uncle Chichikov!”
“Are you ready to go, Chichikov?” said Ted.
Hank observed quietly all this time, and judged that the tragedies he had touched upon had approximated the reality.
“I think this is all becoming clearer and clearer to you, Chichikov,” said Hank, waving good-bye, rather pleased with himself.
“I would like to visit the Gulf War Memorial, Dr. Hank.”
“Are you ready to go, Chichikov?  Let’s go.  The car’s over there.”
“How are you Chichikov?  So, ready?  We’re gonna pick up Mike and Nancy on the way.”
“Mommy!”
“Daaad!  She keeps hitting…”
“Hey, you two behave now for Uncle Chichikov!”
Chichikov lowered his eyes to the source of the piercing scream, and beheld the blonde eight-year old girl whose face was contorted into a bitter pout.  Our hero limited his gaze to objects which were schematic, which did not necessarily have to be seen in order to already be there; objects whose connections with the surrounding context were not complicated, or where there weren’t even any connections in the first place—
“Yeah, the car’s just over here.  So, what Kevin Costner does is he buys a big farm out in Iowa, and you he means business—you know this guy’s not messing around, because of how much money he’s going to payTarget Class: Hard ICBM Launch Silos + Combat Support Assets:How’s that lobster, Ted? Just great.  What happens is he gets captured by the enemy in the battle of Hill 367, and the NVA take him back to a hidden village, where they torture him and keep him prisoner for ten months.  But wasn’t he a Gulf War veteran, Ted?  That’s what I didn’t get.  How do the two tours get reconciled?  Or did you just think that he could be both in the Gulf War and the Vietnam War?  Miller What happens is that the psychiatrist is lying to Kevin Costner, because the truth is that Kevin Costner is part of a secret Army Project, and the psychiatrist wants Kevin Costner to think that he was in a different war from his old buddy played by Bruce Willis, so that they don’t get together and realize they were in the same war, and begin making other connections and remembering the secret Army Project.  Little by little you realize that the psychiatrist is lying to Kevin Costner, played by Liam Nelson, and that he was actually in the same war as Bruce Willis, and that the story which keeps coming up, which Kevin Costner just can’t shake from his head, that he had been captured by the NVA after a firefight on Hill 367 and taken to a village to heal for ten months, turns out to be the story of his comrade, Bruce Willis.  Yeah because there’s that part where Kevin Costner keeps asking Bruce Willis to talk about his experiences, without any success, and then suddenly it turns out that the story which he has told the psychiatrist over and over again, thinking it was his own, is the story of Bruce Willis.  You thought that Bruce Willis had just been reluctant to tell his story, because he didn’t want to go back into all that trauma, but in fact he had transmitted his story to Kevin Costner, and Kevin Costner had just not remembered, because he was still in that mental state where he wasn’t always conscious of what was going on around him, or when it was going on, or what he was doing, because he’s still under the spell of the dementia; and he’s still at a point of convalescence where doesn’t become conscious of many things that are going on around him until later on, when they appear to him in the guise of some other situation or conversation, in an oblique fashion which spares him a direct confrontation with the traumatic contents.  What happens is that Nick Nolte is wounded in the firefight, and the rest of his corps is able to fall back safely, but Nick Nolte is wounded twice in the legs, and so he gets captured by the NVA and taken to a hidden village, from which he is to be taken to a POW camp as soon as he can walk again.  His wounds are cleaned and dressed, and it is clear that it will take several weeks, perhaps months, for the wounds to heal completely.  The rest of the cadre thinks they should just kill him and move on, but the commander overrules them, and allows Nick Nolte to heal.  But an interesting transformation begins to take place in Nick Notle’s heart, in the meantime.  He doesn’t want to kill anymore; he decides he won’t return to his corps when he heals.  He decides to leave war forever.  The months pass by, and the NVA unit commander, a certain Thuy x       ddd, sees that the day is approaching when he will be healthy enough to be transferred to the POW camp.  And you can tell that she senses something of his inner transformation, and is influenced by it.  They never exchange a word, but you can tell that a secret rapport is establishing itself between them.  The rest of the cadre are growing restless and suspicious.  Thuy must make a decision.  She announces that they will begin moving the prisoner to the POW camp on the following day—but in secret she plans to help him escape before dawn.  However, before night falls, Chichikov’s corps arrives, and in the mad rush that follows, Thuy gives Nick Nolte something, it’s not clear what—a gift.  You can really just tell that John Travolta is a genius.  Kissinger convinced Nixon to widen the bombing to Laos and Cambodia.  During one six-month period in 1973 alone, US B-52s dropped 240,000 short tons of bombs across rural Cambodia, 50% more than the total tonnage dropped on Japan during WWII, or the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs.  The Sihanouk government was overthrown and the conditions ripened for the Khmer Rouge to take control.  By the time Pol Pot assumed power in 1975, US bombing had killed 600,000 peasants directly, plus another 1 million by famine resulting from the bombing, and had produced 2 million refugees.  In Laos it is estimated that 350,000 were killed.  To this day, about a thousand Laotian and Cambodian farmers per year are killed by residual, unexploded bomblets, which are manufactured by Boeing with a failure-to-explode rate of 30%.  Taking over the bloodshed, the Khmer Rouge then murdered another million of their countrymen over the course of the remainder of the decade, supplied by Chinese arms via Thailand.  The US gave tacit support to the regime during this period, “winking publicly” as the Chinese underwrote the holocaust (as President Carter’s National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, confessed in 1981).  National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, confessed in 1981 that the Carter Administration had “encouraged the Chinese to support Pol Pot,” during this period, and that the US “winked publicly” as the Chinese underwrote the holocaust.  At last, the Vietnamese army, after suffering repeated Khmer Rouge cross-border raids, sent their army into Cambodia and put an end to the regime in 1979.  In November 1980, Deputy Director Ray Cline, on a clandestine mission to make direct contact with Pol Pot at his base-in-exile.  President-elect Reagan sent a foreign policy adviser, former CIA Deputy Director Ray Cline, on a clandestine mission to make direct contact with Pol Pot at his base-in-exile.  Within the year, 50 CIA agents were stationed in Bangkok and along the Thai-Cambodia border, ostensibly under the name “Kampuchean Emergency Group,” to “monitor the distribution of humanitarian aid” to Cambodian war refugees being carried out by the World Food Program.  But in fact the Kampuchean Emergency Group’s real mandate was (between 1979 and 1981) to redirect humanitarian aid to sustain Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge who were hiding in the jungle.  U.S. aid to the Khmer Rouge also took more direct forms: from 1980 to 1986 Reagan devoted \\$85 million to the rehabilitation of Pol Pot’s forces.  Reagan also ensured that for the duration of the Reagan Administration the Khmer Rouge kept its seat in the U.N., and that the official government in Phnom Penh, meanwhile, was barred from all international agreements on trade and communications, and denied aid even by the World Health Organization.  In 1982 the two party “Coalition of the Democratic Government of Kampuchea” was invented.  But the Khmer Rouge controlled both parties, no elections were held, and the new guise of “Coalition” only permitted the US Kampuchean Emergency Group, which also changed its name to the Kampuchean Working Group, to begin in 1987 providing battle plans, military equipment, and satellite intelligence to the Khmer Rouge under the pretence of assisting non-Khmer Rouge “resistance forces.”  But Prince Sihanouk’s son 09mself, Norodom Ranariddh, acknowledged that the “major attacking forces” were always the Khmer Rouge, whose victories were “celebrated as our own.”  During this period, Congress unleashed an estimated \$24 million in overt and covert aid.  Weapons made in the US, West Germany, and Sweden, were passed through  Singapore or manufactured there under license by Chartered Industries, which is owned by the Singaporean Government, and then sent on to the Khmer Rouge with logistical support from the Thai army Task Force 80.  Congress halted funding in 1990, but because weapons could be produced in nearby Singapore where they were difficult to detect, President Bush Sr. was able to continue supplying the Khmer Rouge in secret, although for how long and to what extent remains uncertain.  The Khmer Rouge did not lose its seat in the UN until 1993.  Remnants of Chiang Kai-shek’s Guomindang army, fleeing to Burma, supported themselves by expropriating the local opium harvest for sale in Thailand.  They sold directly to General Phao Siyanan, head of the Thai police, who governed the largest narco-trafficking syndicate in his country.  When the CIA began organizing Guomindang units for raids into China in 1950, they also began providing General Phao with naval vessels, armored vehicles, aircraft, hundreds of covert and overt advisers; and in 1954 the US Secretary of the Army awarded him the Legion of Merit for “exceptionally meritorious service.”  The CIA also used the opium trade to fund the formation in 1960 of an anti-communist army in Laos under General Yang Pao, whose members were recruited from the native Hmong people of that region.  The CIA furnished logistical support, including US transport aircraft and pilots—“Air America”—to deliver the narcotics to market.  Heroin laboratories sprang up throughout Southeast Asia during this period, many in areas controlled by paramilitary groups supported by the CIA.  The US Bureau of Narcotics reports that General Pao was even operating a lab in Long Tien, where the CIA had its Laos headquarters.  Toward the late sixties, the keenest entrepreneurs recognized their primary market in the huge buildup of US troops in Vietnam, and by 1971, about one-third of GIs were hooked on high purity heroin.  Heroin traffic in South Vietnam was dominated by the air force under Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, the civil bureaucracy under Premier Tran Thien Khiem, and the army-navy and National Assembly under the direct influence of President Nguyen Van Thieu.  Ky and Thieu, for example, financed their election campaigns with drug money.  With Thieu’s victory, the South Vietnamese army became the American GIs’ prime suppliers of high purity heroin.  So then what Kevin Costner does then, after he’s returned home, is he is entered into the psychiatric ward at the Arlington Veterans’ home, and then he tries to work out the details with the ward psychiatrist.  Yeah, I remember that scene when Kevin Costner goes like, “After the crash I was taken prisoner by the NVA, but they treated me fdff							f and took me to the hidden village of N. and dressed my wounds.  I recovered there for like four months, I think it was.”  “Yeah, and Hank, the psychiatrist, goes like: ‘No, Chichikov, after your chopper crashed, you were rescued immediately by special forces.  You healed at Saigon hospital.  And what these new documents say here is that you were transferred to light guard duty at an outpost on Hill 47.’”  “But where was he sent after my MTT indoctrination at Op Center Echo?”  He goes like, no, my chopper crashed on Hill 47.  “No, it was the customs house that was on Hill 47.  You crashed thirty clicks south of Hill 367.”  With Hank he asks, in that all-important scene: “After I crashed on Hill 47,  I think I was captured by an NVA commander, who was then captured after s d  d f f”   “After your chopper crashed, you were rescued immediately along with the rest of your unit.  You healed at the hospital in Saigon.  Then you were listed MIA; your identity was classified, and you were sent to the customs house on Hill 47b to serve light guard duty.”  “But Chichikov, you were rescued by special forces immediately after the chopper crash.  Chichikov goes like: I think it would help, Dr. Hank, if I could visit the Gulf War Memorial.  Yeah.  Most officers who were involved in such massacres as the massacre at Cuarto Pueblo, or Agua Fria, El Mozote, Santiago Atitlan, Xaman, Ixcan, Acul, La Joya, Los Toriles, Dili, Kraras, Jocote Armirillo, Cerro Pando, Joateca, Rancheria, Rio Sumpul, El Calabazo, Los Dos Erres, were applying methods which they learned at the U.S. Army School of the Americas.  During Ambassador Stroock’s tenure in the early 1990s, Guatemalan officers who had conducted such massacres were actually 0nvited to teach classes at the School of 0he 0mericas.  The 1993 U.N. Truth Commission found that Chichikovo D’Aubuisson, then an Army Major, had given the order to kill Archbishop Romero, including precise instructions on how to organize and supervise the event.  The Commission has also found that the Supreme Court has since prevented the extradition of former Captain Saravia, actively involved in the murder, from the U.S., effectively granting impunity to everyone who was involved in the crime.  D’Aubuisson, and many of his colleagues had been trained at the US Army School of the Americas (USARSA or SOA), now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHISC or WHINSEC), in Ft. Benning, Georgia.  In the Ixil region alone 70%-90% of the villages were burnt to the ground.  It is a universally accepted premise that the individual is the subject of any criminal situation, since humans alone possess will and can therefore take decisions based on will: it is individuals that commit crimes, not the institutions they have created.  As a result, it is to individuals and not their institutions that the correspondingpenalties established by law must be applied.   124. Without prejudice to the fact that the active subjects are the intellectual and material authors of the crimes…the State is also responsible, because the majority of these acts were the product of a policy pre-established by a command superior to the material perpetrators.   e49s2:t/:ppt:Archbishop of Guatemala, Juan Gerardi, was murdered at his home on April 26, 1998 by graduates of the US School of the Americas.  Government pressure has led the case to be closed unsolved.  Archbishop Isaias Duarte of Colombia was murdered on March 17, 2002 by graduates of the US School of the Americas in Fort Benning Georgia.  19 of the 26 men involved in the 1989 assassination of 6 Jesuit scholars in San Salvador were graduates of the US School of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, located at Fort Benning Georgia.  The rape and murder of four Ursuline nuns in December 1980 was the work of officers who are graduates of the US School of the Americas, which was originally located in the Canal Zone, but has since been moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, and renamed the Western Hemispheric Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC or WHISC).  Not a single one of these murderers has been sentenced for their crimes.  While Tom Stroock was Ambassador, some of the Guatemalan officers who had carried forth the genocide of Mayans even came to teach classes at USARSA (now WHINSEC or WHISC).  sent in to Guatemala found t978 90% of the recorded atrocities  978 ee 8s pp r ed by0U0900990ary intellig0nc6 and/or yrt7n89g and w0a090s9materiel.

A large plurality of the commanding officers had been trained at the US Army School of the Americas, which was at that time located in the Canal Zone in Panama, but has now been moved located to Ft. Benning, Georgia, under the new name of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation.  From 1983-1886, the Reagan Administration set up Otto Reich in the Office of Public Diplomacy to direct the media’s attention away from these operations.  But New York Times reporter LeMoyne traveled to El Salvador to see things firsthand.  He broke the story on June 5, 1988.  Later the same year CIA Deputy Director for Operations Richard Stolz testified before a Senate Select Intelligence committee that between February 8 and March 13 the CIA had indeed trained the officers involved in the torture of Ines Murillo, including 00ballero, Regalatta, as well as many other Hondurans officers not involved in the0incident, in intelligence and counter-intelligenc.  In 1988, the CIA Deputy Director for Operations Richard Stolz testified before a Senate Select Intelligence committee that between February 8 and March 13 the CIA had trained the officers involved in the torture of Ines Murillo, including Caballero, Regalatta, as well as many other Honduran officers not directly involved in the incident, in intelligence and counter-intelligence.  In Acul, the congregation refused to flee, and was machine-gunned in the church.  Manuel Noriega graduated from the US Army School of the Americas with outstanding marks in 1967.  In 1970 it was George Bush Sr. (then CIA Director) put Noriega on the CIA payroll to the tune of \$100,000 per year.  In 1971 the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics had hard evidence that Noriega was smuggling drugs.  But Bush Sr. maintained good relations with Noriega throughout the period, ensuring that drugs produced in South America were shipped safely through Panama to market in the U.S., in effect underwriting the crack-cocaine epidemic of the 1980s which Reagan so ostensibly fought against.  When Lemoyne’s article hit the press in 1988 Congress placed an immediate ban on military aid to the Contras; and Reagan was forced to rely more heavily than ever on Noriega and the revenues generated by the crack-cocaine epidemic in America’s urban centers to continue funding the Contra army.  But drug profits alone were not enough, and Reagan had to turn to other sources.  He began selling weapons covertly to a number of different clients, most notably his enemy Iran.  Among Reagan’s clients at this time was Osama bin-Laden.,blindfolded, stripped, sexually molested.  The suspect is fed nothing except raw birds; cold water is poured on the suspect’s head every ten minutes to ensure that sleep is impossible.  Forty-eight of the officers cited for human rights violations by the El Salvadoran U.N. Truth Commission had been trained by the U.S. (at USARSA, now known as WHISC or WHINSEC).  President Sukarno was re-elected in 1955, despite intense efforts by the CIA to defraud the elections and to inundate the opposition Masjumi party with funding.  In 1956 Frank Wisner, Deputy Director of Covert Operations, is on record as saying, “I think it’s time we held Sukarno’s feet to the fire.”  In Kennedy’s and Macmillan’s opinion, Sukarno was too lenient toward the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).  They set about creating the conditions for an insurgency, including an abortive effort to forge a porn film suggesting that Sukarno was under the spell of a Soviet seductress.  In November 1957, they received the go ahead from the National Security Council’s Special Group to set up training bases in the Philippines and to prepare airstrips on various islands surrounding Java and Sumatra for bombing and transport missions.  The US Army began training and equipping a mercenary force of Indonesians, Filipinos, Taiwanese, and Americans, numbering in the tens of thousands; and the Air Force contributed 15 B-26 bombers after “sanitizing” them (removing their US insignia).  Headquarters for the operation  were set up in Singapore.  Navy submarines deployed over the beach parties on the shores of Sumatra, carrying supplies and communications equipment.  US Air Force transports parachuted thousands of weapons across the archipelago.  The “rebellion” broke out, in fits and starts, in early 1958, supported by the sanitized B-26 ghost planes.  But the insurgency was unable to overwhelm the Indonesian army; and when ghost pilot Allen Pope was shot down and captured on May 9th, the whole cover was blown.  The CIA abandoned the pretend rebellion to fend for itself, and moved the focus of its efforts once again to Indonesian politics, particularly to the consolidation of the Army as a politically charged entity.  1,200 officers were invited by the US government to study at American universities.  One of these, General Suwarto, who had also, during his period of “study” in the US, been mentored by RAND Corp’s Guy Pauker, founded, upon his return, the Indonesian Army Staff and Command School, or SESKOAD.  Major General Suharto began studies at SESKOAD some time in the early sixties.  The activities and organization of SESKOAD were based on the Army’s new “Doctrine of Territorial Warfare” which was being formulated by Suwarto and his colleagues toward the end of the decade.  In accordance with the Doctrine of Territorial Warfare, SESKOAD officers were trained not only in counterinsurgency, but in economics and administration, and were generally prepared to fulfill the functions of a civilian state.  A “civic missions” program was also initiated under SESKOAD, whereby the Army was able to project its presence—its surveillance and political influence—across the breadth of Indonesian society, extending in some cases down to the village level.  President Kennedy and Congress shared an almost paternal enthusiasm for the civic missions program, and in 1962, acting on a State Department recommendation authored in part by Guy Pauker, they set up a MILTAG group (Military Training Advisory Group) in Jakarta in order to directly administer the program.  Meanwhile, as would happen later on in Chile, all economic aid was shifted from the legally constituted, democratically elected government of Indonesia, to the growing dissident elements within the Army.  During the period 1962-1965, Congress approved \$39.5 million in military aid to these elements (compared to just \$28.3 million for the period 1949-1961).  A June 1962 CIA memo from which the author’s name is deleted confirms that President Kennedy, together with British Prime Minister Macmillan had “agreed to liquidate President Sukarno, depending on the situation and available opportunities.”  In the private sector as well, US oil companies Caltex and Stanvec shifted payment of royalties from the government to dissident-owned companies, such as Permina, headed by General Ibnu Sutowo, (a later close ally to Suharto) and Pertamin, led by Chaerul Saleh, (an anti-PKI politician).  On October 5th, 1965, a group of junior officers from units under Suharto's command killed six high ranking generals in Jakarta.  The officers claimed that they were preempting a coup against President Sukarno, but in fact they murdered precisely the six generals most likely to defend the President.  In a maneuver that was originally seen in Colombia in 1948 (where one million were killed), and that would soon be imitated in Chile, the Congo, Haiti, and Central America, Suharto seized the opportunity to blame the communists for the generals’ murders and take military control of the government under the pretense that he was protecting President Sukarno and the status quo.  Six months later he had forced Sukarno out of office and began the bloody crackdown on the civilian population.  Aside from the “civic missions,” which served as the power infrastructure for the holocaust, the US government also contributed jeeps, radios, and other crucial logistical support, and—through the US Embassy—the names of suspected PKI members, who were then hunted down and killed.  At least some 5,000 civilians are known to have been killed because their names appeared on the lists which the US Embassy passed on to Suharto.  About one million civilians were killed in total when the bloodbath winded down.  Roger Martens, one of the diplomats working in the Political Section of the Embassy at the time and who was involved in the effort, told the Washington Post in 1990, “It really was a big help to the army.  I probably have a lot of blood on my hands, but that’s not all bad.”  Madonna got best actress.  On December 6, Kissinger assured Suharto that East Timor was not a policy issue for the US.  On December 7, Suharto invaded East Timor.  The U.N. Security Council quickly condemned the invasion and ordered Indonesia to withdraw, but the US Ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Patrick Moynihan, vetoed the motion.  As he says in his memoirs, “The United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about.  The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook.  This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.”  Within two months, Moynihan informs us, 60,000 East Timorese had been killed.  From 1977-78, receiving a boost in military aid from Carter’s “Human Rights Administration,” the army launched a sustained offensive on East Timor’s last mountain redoubts, slaughtering 200,000 or nearly a third of the population.  In subsequent years, the US, with assistance from Australia and later Britain, trained the dreaded Kopassus corps, which has authored the majority and most heinous of the atrocities.  In 1981, the US trained forces subjected the population to a forced march across the island, raping, torturing, and killing thousands, including elderly and children, along the way.  In 1983, the army annihilated the East Timorese village of Kraras, killing about 300.  In 1991, Kopassus troops gunned down 271 civilians, including many schoolchildren, during a funeral procession at Santa Cruz Cemetery in Dili; and after the initial massacre, Kopassus soldiers entered hospitals and killed the wounded.  Under Suharto, massacres like this occurred in the hundreds throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and were not limited to the East Timor conflict.  The Santa Cruz massacre was caught on film, and subsequent international outrage forced the US, Britain, and Australia to shift military support, particularly for Kopassus training, to covert channels.  But, nonetheless, as late as 1995 Suharto was cordially welcomed into the White House, and a senior Clinton aide was quoted as calling him “our kind of guy.”  Popular resistance forced Suharto to flee in May 1998.  He was replaced with interim President Habibie, a civilian, who announced a referendum in which the East Timorese would choose between independence or incorporation into Indonesia.  Despite a massacre of 3,500 East Timorese civilians in the summer months leading up to the referendum, the East Timorese turned out in strength and voted overwhelmingly for independence.  Even before the call for referendum, the army had begun recruiting militias from West Timor and had deployed its Kopassus troops nearby.  There were calls from the international community for an independent security force to protect the East Timorese from the imminent onslaught.  Instead, Clinton ordered joint training sessions with Kopassus units in Australia on August 25, just days before the referendum.  The training was put to efficient use after the vote, as the soldiers killed some 10,000 civilians in the first two weeks alone.  It is not clear how many in total were killed by the time this latest wave of atrocities finally subsided.  Reagan sent in 25,000 marines (against 710 construction workers) on October 25, 1984 and overthrew the democratically elected government of Granada.  Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide pointed out that since 1980 the US had bequeathed Haiti \$200 million per year, and yet during this same period (1980-90) the per capita wealth of the nation had fallen by 40%.  Military aid to Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier’s counter-insurgency forces in Haiti was channelled through Israel to avoid embarrassing questions in Washington.  When popular resistance forced Baby-Doc to flee in 1986 aboard a US fighter jet, the US resumed overt assistance, delivering \$30 million of hardware and training within four months.  In the period leading up to the November 1987 elections the military used this aid, in concert with rural US “humanitarian” aid missions, to intimidate voters toward their candidate, murdering more civilians in the process than during the entire 15 years of Baby Doc’s presidency.  It was during this period that Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide first appeared in the American press, when he criticised the military’s domination of the elections and called upon his congregation—the poorest of the poor, living in the slums of Haiti—to boycott the election process altogether.  President Reagan privately labelled him a communist, and Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott Abrams openly attacked him in a letter to Time Magazine, in which he also praised the Haitian military dictatorship.  The elections, postponed to January by violence, were patently fraudulent, Avril.  Popular resistance forced Avril to flee, once again by means of a US jet.  Political upheaval returned suddenly to the country in early 2004, when Duvalier’s butchers began agitating for Aristide’s overthrow.  US marines were deployed to “stabilize the situation,” which resulted in Aristide’s being forced out of the country.  A US diplomat simply told Aristide that his security detail was being withdrawn, and that US marines were entering the palace.  The Bush Jr. Administration claimed to have evacuated him for his own safety.  But in Aristide’s own words the operation was a “coup” and he was “kidnapped.”  Go to www.disney.com.  The US took Iraq off of the State Department’s “States which Sponsor Terrorism” list in 1980 in order to begin selling them illegal chemical and biological weapons, which Sadam eventually used against Iran and his own people.  The US, with strong collaboration from the press, tried to make the chemical attacks look like Iran’s doing.  In 1987 Sadam attacked a US naval vessel, the USS Stark, killing 37 U.S. crewmembers, with impunity.  Just before the invasion of Kuwait, a high-level Senate delegation headed by Bob Dole visited Sadam and assured him that any critical voices he heard in the press did not reflect the President’s genuine sentiment toward him.  92% of the 75,000 killed over the twelve year period were found to be attributable to the Army.  God needs the people themselves to save the world….  The world of the poor teaches us that liberation will arrive only when the poor are not simply on the receiving end of hand-outs from governments or churches, but when they themselves are the masters and protagonists of their own struggle for liberation.  US Marines had occupied Nicaragua from 1912 to 1934, and then supported the Somoza dictatorship from 1934 to 1979.  During the Somoza regime, 4,700 army officers came to study at the US Army School of the Americas in order to put down civil resistance to the dictatorship.  In 1979 the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) overthrew the 45 year tyranny and held the first democratic elections in the nation’s history in 1983.  In the meantime they began building schools, roads, hospitals, and redistributing land, of which, during the Somoza regime, the richest 1% of the population had owned 50%.  This was unacceptable to the Reagan Administration, which in 1980 recruited the remnants of Somoza’s National Guard, and moulded them into a trained and equipped mercenary force called the “Contras.”  The Contras were landed on the east coast of Nicaragua and it was announced that “freedom-fighters” had spontaneously begun fighting against the Sandanista government.  In 1984 the US Navy mined Nicaragua’s harbours.  A newspaper was created and funded by the CIA—La Prensa—which published (and continues to publish) slanderous lies about the FSLN.  Nicaragua took its case to the World Court, and in 1986 the Court ruled in its favour, ordering the US to pay damages of \$million.  The US continues to stand in material breach of this verdict.  During the 2001 elections, US Ambassador Garza appeared before the press surrounded by US military officers dressed in combat fatigues and warned the Nicaraguan people that the U.S. would “not look kindly upon” a Sandanista result in the elections.  In the same breath, and apparently without any intended irony, he then called on the Sandanista party to “embrace democratic policies.”  The Sandanistas are responsible for the first democratic elections in the country’s history, and for the first peaceful, democratic transition of power from one democratically elected administration to another.  The U.S., by contrast, trained 4,700 officers over the course of two decades with the precise aim of preventing democratic elections from ever taking place.  Training of Nicaraguan officers at WHINSEC resumed the same year.  The manual “Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare,” published by the U.S. School of the Americas, was distributed in Nicaragua in 1983.  Among its contents were instructions on torture and how to have a fellow soldier killed and then turned into a martyr.  Kaibil units were trained by the Green Beret.  Training of counter-insurgency forces included killing animals, eating them raw, and drinking their blood “to demonstrate courage.”  During massacres, civilian victims were made to mutilate the corpses of their friends and family, and to torture, rape, and kill those still alive, before themselves being killed.  The Army entered the town of Cuarto Pueblo on March 13, 1982, at the hour of the morning mass.  The lieutenant drew up his troops and assured them that the civilians of the town were guerrillas, and that “thanks to the U.S., our soldiers won’t be cut down.”  They then went systematically through the town, taking people from their houses or places of work and shooting them.  When they entered the church, the congregation refused to flee and were machine gunned where they stood.  Small children were gathered and corralled into a shed, and then soldiers machine gunned the shed until all of the children were dead.  Even as the corpses were heaped into piles and burnt, the young women of the town were made to cook meals for the soldiers, and were then raped once the meal was finished, and then killed and thrown onto the pyres.  324 were massacred in total, over a three day period.  The murder of Archibishop Oscar Romero as he gave mass on March 3, 1980, was planned and executed by graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas.  19 of the 26 soldiers and officers involved in the planning and execution of the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests in San Salvador had been trained at USARSA.  The murder of Archbishop Juan Gerardi outside his home in Guatemala on April 26, 1998, was also carried out by graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas.  The murder of Colombian Archbishop Isaias Duarte on March 17, 2002, was also carried out by graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas.  The torture, rape, murder, and mutilation of three nuns and one lay missionary in Nicaragua in 1980 was also planned and executed by graduates of the U.S. Army School of the Americas.  The rape and torture of an Ursuline nun in Guatemala was carried out by trainees from the U.S. Army School of the Americas, now known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC or WHISC), located at Ft. Benning, Georgia.

Perception is aphoristic, disjointed, fragmentary, not unlike the mirror you broke in the Rec Hall during our last Literary Night, Chichikov.  Dementia is often compared to a shattered mirror:  The reality remains the same, but the perception is shattered into thousands of fragments and episodes which are so many repetitions of each other.  In an unbroken mirror, objects are reflected in their completeness, and then a new object can be placed before the mirror for reflection.  In a demented mind, however, the mirror has been shattered—against the object, if you will, which is in this case the suppressed, traumatic contents.  And the dementia holds up one shard, then another, to the same suppressed object of perception, trying to get the shard to reflect something else, anything else besides what is there—and, failing and casting away the shard in disgust, which breaks into more pieces.
	The dementia holds up another shard to the same reality again and again, in different shades and different angles, and in the process different aspects and nuances of the repressed trauma are uncovered and come to light.  But the reality remains the reality.
	The dementia tries to get the reality to be different from what it is.  It holds up different shards of different shapes and sizes, in different shades and angles, and so your thinking becomes repetitive, episodic, disjointed.  Or rather your thinking, your perception, your process of apprehending what is around you, more and more assumes the form of an episode repeating itself again and again in slightly different guises which give an impression that some sort of overall progress is being made.  That the fragments are adding up to some totality, but in fact it is only the same shard of quicksilver being held up again and again, the same episode.
	But, as in the mirror, it is not the fragments in themselves that will eventually make sense, but the spaces in between them—even if you are one day successful in remembering all the facts of your past, and can line them up one after the other, they will have little more meaning than when they were forgotten if you do not understand the connection between them.
	There is always something missing from your perception, which you go filling in little by little—but only after the fact.



On the one hand there is an imperative to answer the question “what happened to me?”  On the other hand, there is an imperative to self-preservation, to protect the general syntactical operating coherence on which the mind is premised.
Because the contents cannot be countenanced within the general system of conscious activity, Traumatic contents can bear such an intense emotional charge that their presence in the general system of conscious activity impairs the lower functionality.  Because they cannot be countenanced, the mind, in what is essentially an act of self-defense, will take measures to mask their significance.  The question of “what happened” cannot be answered, because the answer would destroy the general syntactical coherence.  The act of recognizing the contents for what they are, of comprehending the narrative of events which have placed you in your current state of cognitive disorder, would undermine the lower functionality.  And so what happens Chichikov is that the mind, in what is essentially an act of self-defense, takes whatever measures are at its disposal to render the traumatic contents unrecogniziable.
The question of why the mind doesn’t simply shut down and die under such pressures remains a hotly debated mystery. But most researchers agree that the mind is an entropy reducing machine. It is teleologically driven to organize and make sense of the world, to order disordered contents. …
Direct recognition of the traumatic contents would destroy the mind, and yet these contents cannot be erased from the mind, and so the mind is faced with two paradoxical imperatives. It must reduce entropy and yet also expel the pathogen. But the contents cannot be expelled like some pathogen, it is not composed of cells but of illusions built upon other illusions. what happens is that the mind forges self-preserving subconscious mechanisms to suspend the contents from the general system of conscious activity. What ensues is a sort of masque whereby the subconscious mechanisms continuously demolish and recombine the traumatic contents into forms which partly reveal but partly distort or submerge the reality.  of cognitive frames, memory shards, half submerged faces. What ensues [reflective symmetry later on: The dead did not, merely by virtue of their being dead, vanish.  And what the military hardware did was suspend the living into an abstract, nebulous realm, a sort of masque of cognitive frames that sliced up the living into small pieces that were then scattered across the subconscious regions of the sierra…]  And what happens in cases such as yours, Chichikov, is that the mind permutes   but rather must render them as unrecognizable as possible.  The mind will subconsciously churn through the different possible permutations of arrangements of sharded memories. On the one hand, the mind must reject this task, in the interest of its own self-preservation; while on the other hand, the mind is teleologically driven to resolve the question, and gradually draws more and more of the brain’s cognitive resources into the melee.  And what happens, Chichikov, is that the mind will superimpose onto the immediately surrounding environment of sensuously manifest, cognitive surface features, these cycles of permutations, almost as a game.  And each of the permutations is vaguely accurate, but fails to hit the mark.  Giving you a distorted version.
The message is buried in the syntax.  The message is syntax.  It is not that the message is replaced by the cognitive delivery structure.  Rather what I mean to say is that the message becomes so enveloped in the syntactical self-similarity that any distinction between the message and the carrier structure becomes meaningless.
Content is itself a formal way of rendering unfamiliar forms, of parsing through symbols and archetypes which seem to resonate. You’ll never get down to a final layer which can be identified as the source, the bedrock of meaning.  Alan Turing proved this.
And what you’ll find, Chichikov,  is that your mind will parse through the different possible permutations of arrangements of shards, but without ever getting down to a final layer of meaning which you can call real or authentic.  Children are taught in school that the content of a cyphertext is the message.  But you have figured out by now that a message is its own cyphertext—another syntactical structure called English or Russian or Farsi meant to be parsed by consciousness.  There is no reason, then, to call the message deciphered by consciousness the final meaning or the core meaning hidden within the cypher.  What you might call the “core meaning,” then, is itself another syntactical structure, a cognitive delivery system.  Ciphers do not encode messages; they encode other cyphers.  Languages do not convey meaning, but rather other languages.  Languages are not surface realizations of “deep structure,” but of other languages. It is completely arbitrary what level of encryption you choose to call the “message” hidden within the cipher. If there is something at all meaningful about a language, it is its fractal dimension—the measure of how much a language fails to fill the cognitive space. This is what Godel realized in his unpublished notebooks.
The suppressed contents, merely by their being suppressed, do not disappear.
And what happens, Chichikov, is that the mind will suspend the traumatic contents, but the traumatic contents, merely by their being repressed, do not go away.  Because they are unbearable to behold, the mind subconsciously disconfigures them into an unrecognizable form.  The picture of “what happened” is shattered into fragments which are then scattered throughout the subconscious regions of the brain.  However, the information is not thereby deleted, and can be reconstituted from the shards.  The mind continues to try to piece the puzzle together.
The mind will superimpose the suppressed contents onto the surrounding environment.

[reflective symmetery with the dead:]

Chichikov knew that the dead, merely by their being dead, did not vanish altogether.  The dead left a mark—the little divot of air marking their having once been alive—and that this was very different from people who didn’t exist.
Chichikov knew that the dead, merely by their being dead, did not vanish altogether.  The dead left a sort of divot in the aether no longer occupied by their souls—the mark of their having once been alive. This was very different from people who didn’t exist.  This was the much overlooked but critical difference between death and non-existence.  People who were dead had the property of having once been alive.  It was thus possible for other people who were still in the state of being of alive to know of their having existed, and to know of how they passed from the state of being alive to the state of being dead.  The very state of being alive called into existence the binary state space of alive/dead. … However, the hardware could only suspend the living from their lives, at which point they became dead; the hardware could pulverize the living, and then scatter the pieces across the mountains, forests, rivers, and oceans, but it could not erase the fact that the scattered remains had once composed living bodies.

Chichikov: What year is it, Hank?
Chichikov toggled the, putting himself squarely within Hank’s bandwidth.
Hank: But you’re making excellent progress, Chichikov!, and I want you to be proud of that.  Now you’re still struggling, I know, to frame things in their proper context; and it’s tough—ward psychiatrists call this phase the most difficult phase of convalescence.  I’ve decided to reactivate visiting rights on your file again, and to start up your class section again.  But you’re doing an excellent job, Chichikov, making terrific progress, and I think it will be time to start up your class section again.
And then they had a little laugh over the joke.

<!-- Andrei looked up at the sky from under his brow, letting his labor wane a little, and giving his eyes to peek out a little from under the shadow of his brow-line; he felt his eyes emerging from the shadow into the light a little.  He thought, “No, a peacock could not elbow past this banner.”  The contour of his skull where it formed around his eyes lent a darkness to the overall impression of his countenance which people Andrei met in general never put their finger on.  Now, like the thin stem of a flower which rises from the bulb in the soil, Andrei tilted his face at the sky, like the saints in the paintings, when the white dove descends into Mary’s womb, and the saints are gathered around, their heads tilted a little at what is going on in the sky, what is the commotion with the goldenrod in the sky and the dove.  He heard the ch’ih-chaung of the cash register and saw the thin stem of the flower rising heavenward.  Just as the stem which sprouts forth from the bulb beneath the soil, and not some sum or calculation as if made by machine.  Just so, Andrei felt his vision rising to Heaven. -->
<!-- 	Then how was it his vision rose to Heaven?  If nothing but what did not evaporate in the face of reason held primacy then what was his vision doing, rising up to Heaven?  He tilted his face at the sky in a pious air, trying to look up after his vision.  Where it was floating off to, and the commotion it made in the sky.  Was it only that he was looking up?  No, he saw his vision clearly floating up through the sky like a rose stem which climbs up from the bulb, sprouting first leaves.  He knew his eyeballs were the bulbs of his vision.  When his vision had sprouted a little ways up, then little leaves would spread, which were like wings which climbed the air.  Leaves, and any sort of life, really, were just the wings which pulled through the ether.  What body the wings belonged to, i.e. life proper which finds itself dragged through the ether, was by turns life’s great question and life’s great answer.  As for what was the “ether” or what kind of feathers and such, these were just words. -->
<!-- 	His vision pulled through, infinitely incalculable.  The cash register gave a little ch’au-chang, and what rose Heavenward, what sum, or price, but the stem of a flower!		Andrei knew what he was thinking about now.  He was remembering how he heard all of the Pianos begin to play as he walked down the street to his mother’s house.  Not to say he was not remembering his past too.  But this other remembrance—the remembrance of the Pianos—turned out to have worn his past as a masque just then; thereby to communicate itself to him.  As a rule Andrei never pretended.  His recounting his past was just the secret language by which the minuter remembrance of the Pianos could communicate itself to him just then.  He tried to picture his thoughts in his head to figure out how they pulled off such stunts as this one.  The trunk of a tree began taking shape before him (in his mind).  One half was pink, demarcating one thought, and one half was blue, demarcating the other thought.  No, that model would not do.  His thoughts of his past and his remembrance of the Pianos were of different woods, perhaps of different elements.  The former encompassed all Andrei’s life.  The latter only a half-hour or so.  The latter was only a remembrance, while the former was his past.  Yet this mere remembrance had suffused all his past, used all of its moments to communicate itself!  Had it been so grandiose, the sight of all the Pianos?  Andrei tried hard to remember now:  He had been walking through the capital, peeking over the window sills at all the Pianos in the houses where probably the aristocrats lived.  Then he had heard it.  The Pianos had begun their playing all at once.  He had begun his jumping again, his peeking over the window sills to see what the people looked like playing the pianos but no one was seated at any of the Pianos.  The Pianos were playing by themselves. -->
<!-- It did not make sense that the piano played all by itself with no one at the keys and without it being a player piano—but that was the point of it.  And then it doubly did not make sense that the point of it was that it was a piano that played by itself without any special mechanical device or without a ghost that actually played the piano.  “This is Pianism,” thought Andrei, “this is my movement.—And I am its first martyr!” -->
<!-- He knew that it did not make sense—there were better metaphors to be sure, Kafka’s Castle, Beckett’s Mallone (I’ll go on.  I won’t go on), the Thirty-sixth case of the Mumonkan, for example (A Man of Tao along the Way)—all of the great thinkers who had come before him had already captured it and expressed it in the best way possible, he knew, and that they would say that it did not make sense that the point behind the Piano was that it played by itself—and not because of the aid of some special mechanical device or not because a ghost was playing the piano—the piano was a normal piano, but it played without anyone touching the keys.  Nor was there a ghost present. -->
<!-- “Why did it play all by itself?” they would belabor him with their interrogations, “Very well, you say there’s no mechanism behind it, nothing to be grasped and put into discourse.  But what benefit is to be gained?” -->
<!-- “The benefit, dear sir,” said Andrei on that occasion, “is your very consternation and questioning—that is the whole point!” -->

<!-- Huddled ever closer to the ivory slats of the piano—the sign of the cross—dropping them, picking them up again—knowing what he had to do with them, after the most blackguardly manner—labor and capital—quasi-born thing—work is love—knew the games—sensuously manifested putrefaction—the smile as broad as the horizon—the sickening din of steel-coated lathis against unprotected skulls.  There would not be a book that would not be a manifesto.  There would not be a word that would not be a doctrine.  It was not possible to say a word that was not a manifesto.  Not that he had decided it.  You were born into a world, did certain things, were of a certain ilk, thought Andrei.  Well, the world registered it in certain ways, was all he could see.  You did not decide to be of one ilk or another.  You were just a certain way that you had not done, and then the people said “you were that way,” even though it had not been so.  Then this fact, of which no one was guilty, made a certain mark upon the world.  Later on you had the illusion of having done something. -->
<!-- 	They were at dinner.  One of the gentlemen seated at the table was asking him why one of the chapters bore a title.  It did not make sense.  All of the other chapters were numbered, then came chapter two which was called A First Martyr of the Pianist Movement.  Why?  Were you about pianos or orchestras?  Did he want to be a writer when he grew up?  He huddled close to the ivory slats.  He had to fasten the ivory slats to the keys of the piano.  His hands trembled; the slats fell from his hand and he had to pick them up again. -->
<!-- 	And now they charged him with aloofness, pomposity, condescension.  Yes, they, the dinner guests, the inventors of the loamy depth.  “All in all,” they said, and: “when it comes right down to it.” -->

The one of how it would seem to be a serious thing at first but then turned out to be a joke, the true genius of it.  You could be serious if you were Samuel Beckett, for example, or Maya Angelou.  But then after that it was not possible to be serious.  Andrei had been born after the end of seriousness.  And now you could no longer be serious if it did not turn out later that you had only been joking when it seemed that you were serious.  There were the different ways to say it, the different funny things.  The only one way to see it the life of blustery.  A long, overwrought structure.  The different ways to mean it.  Some of them meant it in a way you didn’t catch at first.  Then some of them meant it in a different way and they got rich.  You were by turns obscure, by turns rich.  O great wisdom!  By turns died obscure and poor, by turns were rich and acclaimed, and O great wisdom of the literary movement great idol.  You alternately rotted away unfit for life and were not even discovered by posterity, alternately held the token of power and fame and were thus ignorant and conceited and were despised when the light of posterity shone on your ignorance and conceit; and thus unfit for life.  You had this way, O great scholarly wisdom,” thought Andrei, in praise of “meeting yourself around back.  Of the extremes meeting and becoming one great universal cycle.  There was that one problem of the conceit of youth, that problem of being able to say such awful, tasteless things without even knowing it.  The long, overwrought artifice stretched out before you, an unworkable quay used by ancestors; it made you vulnerable to the great error of not writing a good novel.  Of finding no way to give an aesthetic sense to your life.  You could end up saying for example, “We are like Dido and Aeneas.”  You could make that error, and then no one would like you. -->
<!-- You looked back even now in the baleful youth of twenty years, even now looked back with wat’ry-eyed hindsight of forty years, to condemn, with even-eyed sobriety pouring out upon the page, the jerky phrase: -->

<!-- No, I cannot countenance it. -->

<!-- Uncommunicative, they had said.  But he had wanted nothing more than to communicate his fellow man.  But there could be no greater disservice to a man than to talk to him in his own language.  For that was patronage.  ‘Twas condescension and aloofness.  No!  Down with windy bourgeois sentiment!  Down with Chummy meta-language!  The aim of literature was to forge a public of actual dignity.  Of the old kind we have had enough—more than enough!  Will you preach to the old kind of public—the stranglers and emasculators of the present age?  All they are interested in is hearing tales about how their outrageous crimes are just.  Should you whisper something else, should you not help them along to the precipice—toward which they are limping with all their might!—they will insult you, viz. they will call you pompous and condescending, insensitive, aloof.  No, with them there is nothing more to talk about.  The whole point of the new literature is that it does not waste its time there, must direct its voice to the new man and the new woman, must be a salutation to the new public, those who will defend the future from the stranglers of the present age—to real dignity, conscious of itself, and not the mimetic, old semblances. -->
<!-- Communicate with a man, thought Andrei, clutching the ivory slats to his chest, dropping them, picking them up again, cutting himself against the flat edges, reach out to a man, win a man’s trust—only to help him along to the edge of the precipice toward which he already mightily limps!, only to insert him further into his shit-world of conceit and self-deception, to assuage his fears that he will go to hell, that his crimes are forgiveable (and thereby sell a book)—no!  That could not be communication.  And—would it not be better to break the legs of such a public, so they will limp no more? -->
<!-- They were asking him what he meant at the dinner table.  Fate: even if you were to The crux of it lay in this: Fate.  Even if you were to leave off in the middle somewhere the notes would still conduce one to the end; so that if one were to do it correctly it would lead to that inevitable end.  Once the basso continuo began playing the descent into the grave it would not stop; it would repeat all the times necessary (37) until Dido’s steps took her into the grave.  If one were to decide to do it correctly.  So that even in the event that the orchestra should stop playing—and why should it?  Life does not stop playing without the orchestra—and one were to say, “No, I shall leave off here.  I do not like where this is headed.”  And you set off down your path of private inquiry, dedicating whole sections of your life to research and introspection; even then the notes upon the page would not be altered and would still lead to the end, so that all your years of learning and introspection could not but lead you, by the very fruit of your learning and introspection, right back to the moment of rejection of the truth at the core of existence: the piano notes lead to the end.  And not in a different way but in just the way, -->
<!-- The astutest at the dinner table made the following remark: “There is a certain grotesquerie, a motif pathetique or enfant that you are belaboring and trying to make new.  But there is not the triumph of Joyce’s Daedalus.” -->
<!-- That kind of triumph is only a provisional triumph.  It was a noble attempt and Andrei smiled.  It was different from what others said.  But you were not able to define it no matter what you said.  Even had you said the most outrageous things it would still not be defined.  “That is what the world does not, and may never, understand about the Pianist Movement,” thought Andrei later on when he went over it in his mind.  Take any work of art and its corresponding body of scholarship.  Take a literary work, for example, or a painting: The objective of scholarship has been to induct the artwork or art-emotion into the framework of familiar thought.  But scholarship, thought Andrei, if it is to exist, must be oriented in the opposite direction. -->
<!-- “No!  If it is really to be of any use to humanity, then scholarship must push the art-object out further into ever more unfamiliar regions of consciousness, so that we are drawn out further with it.  Improved access to the artwork—or, more properly, to the truth it points to—is a good thing; but we must not deign to bring it closer to us, but rather be made to go out to it.  Any work of art that we can hold in the palm of our hand has failed as an artwork.  This was what I had understood by a ‘literary movement,’” Andrei had told the dinner guests seated at the table with him that night.  “The problem with that, you will object,” Andrei had said, “is that the Pianist Movement is of no use to those who are left behind.  Those who are drawn out to the artwork will presumably encounter a new reality which they will be unable to transmit to those of us who have stayed behind. -->
<!-- “In which group would you rather be?” asked Andrei then rhetorically.  Fine then, he had made his point.  There was neither coherence nor incoherence nor both coherence and incoherence nor neither coherence nor incoherence.  All levels of understanding were levels of delusion.  Both delusion and understanding were approximations of the truth and as such at least one step away from it.  It was important to be in the group that went out and perished and did not come back, Andrei knew, because that was the group that had reached the truth, just as the moth had reached the flame. -->
<!-- For that reason they fell silent, found no use for theories and could no longer distinguish between a good carreer move and a bad one.  Andrei himself, Andrei knew, was on the verge of being drawn “too far out” and immolating himself in the moth flame, hence the dilated parameters.  The parameters were:  the fate was: he dreamt once: -->
<!-- After the point of not coming back there would be nothing, not even a blank page.  However, he had still not been consumed in his sorrows and travails, and that was why you still caught glimpses of what it was.  You caught certain dilated or distorted glimpses but it was not true. -->



Now their number was called and the two gentlemen stood up from their umbrella table and ambled across the creaking pier boards in the direction of the waiter’s signal frequency.  Here you are, said the grinning black-vested waiter, opening his palm voraciously in the direction they must follow.  Chichikov was stricken and they continued on into the elevator, Hank and Chichikov, and descended beneath the pier they sank cozily into shiny next-form suits which were already half-submerged in the bay.

Intermittent forms of grey and white and green sprawling pitifully in the murk of algae.

Chichikov said: What I would like, Hank, are the names of those who are still alive, but who have died with respect to legal form.  Your dead souls.
Hank: What happens, Chichikov, is that the mind creates a masque or dementia to cover over the suppressed contents, distorting them, and distorting everything that surrounds them, everything that bears the slightest connection to them.  Distorting reality.  The mind not only projects a fictitious event in place of the actual experiences sustained, but projects the whole fictitious background to that fictitious event.  The psychosis projects not only the distorted object, but the distorted world in which it takes place.  The object and field of objectification are the same.  What is called the truth is the composite of these two. / The mind projects a fictitious artifice onto the reality of the experiences sustained—the object of trauma—but it also projects the whole background, the whole field in which it is objectified.  It is the nature of the mind to objectify not only the object, but objectification and the field of objectification.  In the falsification, the making a fiction out of, the object, the field of objectification is also rendered a distorted reflection of itself, and objectification itself is also falsified and made a fiction of: that is, the mode of cognition which produces this falsification is rendered identical to that of the novel.  By projecting the distorted object, the psychosis projects the distorted world.  The obfuscation of the truth content is the projection of the obfuscated truth content and the obfuscated universe of cognition, and hence obfuscated obfuscation, and the distorted distortion.  The whole mind organizes itself around the suppression of the truth content, becoming a function of the suppression, which becomes the central formative activity of consciousness.  But what happens is that when the suppressed content of the past bears an especially powerful psychical charge, the effort required to continue suppression is unsustainable; it threatens to annihilate the whole mind—But this is the problem which we began with: nothing can be annihilated.  It is the illusory aim of suppression to annihilate the suppressed contents.  But it is an illusory aim.  It is impossible to annihilate anything.  What happens is that eventually the suppressed truth content emerges again.  The masque of dementia begins to disintegrate in places, and the truth of the past emerges through the disintegration.

It is a universally accepted premise that the individual is the subject of any criminal situation, since humans alone possess will and can therefore take decisions based on will: it is individuals that commit crimes, not the institutions they have created.  As a result, it is to individuals and not their institutions that the corresponding penalties established by law must be applied.

“But the constant imagined reversal of the experience, the suppression of reality—both of past and present—and the uncontrovertible fact that you did experience these unbearable things, amounts also to a distortion of the reality of the present.  If you do not have the courage to countenance the reality of the past is impossible to countenance, so is the reality of the present.  It was the universally accepted premise that there were no connections of causality between the atrocities carried out by the state and the stateforces, as Pain did not bear a relation between itself and a putative “cause of pain.”  It could not be traced back to a source of the pain, but bore only relation to itself as its sole proine reality.  Otherwise the pain—which can only be said to exist in a provisional, putative sense—does not exist.  In the instant that the “suffering,” the “massacres,” are “traced back” to a given set of “origins,” “a given set of perpetrators,” and so forth, “state apparatuses,” “G2,”  etc. “the United States of America,” for example, and so on, They cease to exist—because in the instant that the atrocities are traced back to their real causes, the premise of their existence is erased.

The Clarification Commission found the State responsible for 93% of the registered human rights violations, indicating a persistent and systematized campaign of abuses, with peaked intensity during the six year period, when 91% of the violations occurred.  Whether acting alone or in concert with other forces, the Army was found responsible for 85% of all human rights violations and violence registered by the committee.  And the “Civil Defense Patrols,” created by the Army, were found guilty of the remaining 18%.

Welcome to

THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL MEMORIAL

FACTS FOR THE VISITOR

e567/56:// Welcome to the Vietnam War Memorial Memorial (originally located beside the Lincoln Memorial).  In the old days, war was thought of more in the narrow sense of “armed conflict,” rather than of market-correcting phenomena, and you will notice that the structure here preserved (originally built in 1982) differs from the other War Memorials on the Mall accordingly—most striking perhaps is its absolute lack of any data tickers or digital streaming devices/LCDs.  Originally constructed in 1982, the vexing swoop of black marble and the engraved list of fatalities apparently referred only to a specific period of the Vietnam conflict and not to the ongoing, permanent equilibria-event.  The vexing swoop of black marble and the rather unwieldy engraved list of fatalities apparently referred only to a specific period of the Vietnam conflict (most likely the original period, 1965-1973).  Astonishing as it may be to today’s visitors, the original function of this monument appears to have been nothing more than to remind people that the “conflict” had “happened.”  The data which you see chiseled out on the low monolith face, for example, is completely unautomated, and is not linked to the Stock Exchange in any way.

Chichikov regarded the names engraved in the marble slabs one last time:

It is interesting because you don’t know in the end if it is really happening or just another projection of the dementia; or whether the events of the past really happened or were just adornments superimposed by the psychosis on top of the truth, which was still too painful to face.  You are never sure whether the reality that is being presented is the reality of what actually happened, or just another projection of the dementia; and what you don’t wonder is whether the present reality is actually a manipulation of what is happening in order to reflect something else which, even though it had happened, remained unarticulated.
